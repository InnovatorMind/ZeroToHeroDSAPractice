## ðŸŸ¢ Basic Vector Creation & Access
1. Create a vector of integers and insert 5 elements (any values).
2. Print all elements of a vector using a loop.
3. Access the first and last element using `front()` and `back()`.
4. Take `n` inputs from the user and store them in a vector.
5. Initialize a vector with 10 elements, all having value 7.
6. Find the size of a vector using `size()`.

## ðŸŸ¡ Modifying a Vector
7. Add elements at the end using `push_back()`.
8. Remove the last element using `pop_back()`.
9. Insert an element at index 2 using `insert()`.
10. Erase the element at index 3 using `erase()`.
11. Clear the vector using `clear()` and show its size.
12. Resize the vector to 5 elements using `resize()`.

## ðŸŸ  Traversing and Printing
13. Print all elements using `for` loop.
14. Print all elements using `for-each` loop.
15. Print all elements using iterators.

## ðŸ”µ Sorting and Searching
16. Sort a vector of integers in ascending order.
17. Sort it in descending order.
18. Find if a given element `x` is present using `find()` (from `<algorithm>`).
19. Count occurrences of an element in a vector.
20. Find the minimum and maximum element using `min_element` and `max_element`.

## ðŸŸ£ Intermediate Logic
21. Take `n` inputs from user, store in vector, and reverse it.
22. Remove all even numbers from a vector.
23. Take two vectors and add their corresponding elements into a third vector.
24. Take a vector of size `n` and print only the duplicate elements.
25. Take a vector and rotate it one place to the right.

## ðŸ”º 2D Vectors (for later)
26. Create a 2D vector of size 3x3 and initialize it.
27. Take matrix input using 2D vector and print it.
28. Add two 3x3 matrices using 2D vectors.
29. Find the transpose of a 2D vector (matrix).
30. Count how many rows have even sum in a 2D vector.
