## ðŸ§  Problem: **Sliding Window Maximum**

You are given an array of integers and a window size `k`. Your task is to print the **maximum** of every contiguous subarray of size `k`.

---

### ðŸ“¥ Input:

* An array `arr[]` of `n` integers.
* An integer `k` (window size).

---

### ðŸ“¤ Output:

* Print the maximum of each window (space-separated).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example:

**Input:**

```cpp
arr[] = {1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7}
k = 3
```

**Output:**

```
3 3 5 5 6 7
```

---

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

Windows of size 3:

* \[1, 3, -1] â†’ max = 3
* \[3, -1, -3] â†’ max = 3
* \[-1, -3, 5] â†’ max = 5
* \[-3, 5, 3] â†’ max = 5
* \[5, 3, 6] â†’ max = 6
* \[3, 6, 7] â†’ max = 7

---

### ðŸ’¡ Hint:

Use a **deque** to:

* Store indices of useful elements
* Keep elements **in decreasing order**
* Remove elements **out of window range**

---

### ðŸ”§ Bonus Tip:

Deque helps maintain a "max candidate list" by:

* Removing smaller elements from the back (not useful)
* Removing elements out of the current window from the front
