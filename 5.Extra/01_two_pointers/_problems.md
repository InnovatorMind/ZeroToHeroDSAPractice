### 👶 1. **Find Pair with Target Sum in Sorted Array**
> Write a function that finds any two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a given target.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}, target = 9  
Output: Pair found: (4, 5)
```

---

### 💨 2. **Check If Array Has Duplicates**
> Use two pointers to check if any adjacent elements in a sorted array are duplicates.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 3, 5}  
Output: true
```

---

### 🔁 3. **Reverse an Array In-Place**
> Write a program to reverse an array without using any extra space — just two pointers.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
Output: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```

---

### 🧩 4. **Move Zeros to End**
> Using two pointers, move all zeros to the end of the array while keeping the order of non-zero elements.
```cpp
Input: nums = {0, 1, 0, 3, 12}  
Output: {1, 3, 12, 0, 0}
```

---

### 🌊 5. **Check if Array is a Palindrome**
> Use two pointers to check whether the array reads the same forward and backward.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}  
Output: true
```

---

### 🧮 6. **Count Pairs with Difference Equal to K**
> Count how many unique pairs have a difference of exactly K in a sorted array.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 3, 5, 7}, k = 2  
Output: 3 pairs → (1,3), (3,5), (5,7)
```

---

### 🧊 7. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
> Modify the array in-place so that all unique elements appear at the start.
```cpp
Input: nums = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}  
Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
