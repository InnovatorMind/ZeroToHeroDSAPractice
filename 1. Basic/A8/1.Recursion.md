### **What is Recursion?**  
Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller subproblems of the same type until a base condition is met.  

### **Why is Recursion Used?**  
1. **Solving Problems with a Natural Recursive Structure:** Problems like tree traversal, graph traversal (DFS), and factorial calculation have a recursive nature, making recursion a good fit.  
2. **Simplifies Code:** Some problems are easier to solve recursively, reducing the need for complex loops and conditionals.  
3. **Used in Divide & Conquer Algorithms:** Algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search use recursion to divide the problem into smaller parts.  
4. **Backtracking & Dynamic Programming:** Problems like the N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver, and Fibonacci series use recursion.  

### **Why Use Recursion When We Have Loops?**  
- Loops (like `for`, `while`) are iterative and can solve many problems efficiently, often with better memory optimization.  
- However, recursion is helpful when a problem naturally breaks down into smaller subproblems, such as tree traversals or the Tower of Hanoi.  
- **Recursion can sometimes lead to stack overflow (infinite recursion) if not handled properly.**

### **Loops vs Recursion: A Detailed Comparison**  

| Feature          | Loops (Iteration) | Recursion |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Definition**  | Uses constructs like `for`, `while`, or `do-while` to repeat a block of code until a condition is met. | A function calls itself repeatedly until a base condition is met. |
| **Memory Usage** | Uses constant memory (`O(1)`) since it does not create new function calls. | Uses additional stack space (`O(n)`) due to function calls, which may lead to stack overflow. |
| **Speed & Performance** | Generally faster as it avoids the overhead of function calls. | Slower due to repeated function calls and stack management. |
| **Ease of Understanding** | Easier for simple repetitive tasks (like looping over an array). | More intuitive for problems with a recursive structure (like tree traversal). |
| **Complexity Reduction** | May require extra logic to maintain state in problems like DFS or tree traversal. | Reduces complexity in problems that naturally divide into subproblems. |
| **Base Case Handling** | Not required explicitly. | A base condition is mandatory to stop infinite recursion. |
| **Use Cases** | Suitable for simple loops, array traversals, and situations where memory optimization is needed. | Used in divide & conquer problems, tree/graph traversal, and problems with a recursive nature. |
| **Risk of Infinite Execution** | If loop conditions are not handled correctly, it can result in an infinite loop. | If the base case is not defined correctly, it can result in infinite recursion and stack overflow. |

### **When to Use Loops?**
- When the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- When performance and memory efficiency are priorities.
- Examples:
  - Iterating over an array.
  - Printing numbers from 1 to 100.
  - Simple counting problems.

### **When to Use Recursion?**
- When a problem naturally divides into smaller subproblems.
- When solving problems like tree/graph traversal, factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking.
- When implementing divide & conquer algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
