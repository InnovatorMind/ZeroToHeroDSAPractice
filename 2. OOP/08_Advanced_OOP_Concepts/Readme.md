# Advanced OOP Concepts

Welcome to the Advanced OOP Concepts module! Here, we delve deeper into advanced features of C++ object-oriented programming including:

- **Operator Overloading:** Customize built-in operators for user-defined types.
- **Friend Functions and Friend Classes:** Grant special access to private members.
- **Static Members:** Share data between all objects of a class.
