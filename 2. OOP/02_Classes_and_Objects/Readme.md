# Classes and Objects

Welcome to the second module of our OOP learning journey! In this section, we'll delve into the fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming: **Classes and Objects**. You'll learn how to define classes, create objects, and understand how attributes and methods work together to model real-world entities.

### **Contents:**

- **concepts/**
  - [Classes.md](concepts/Classes.md): Blueprint of objects.
  - [Objects.md](concepts/Objects.md): Creating instances.
  - [Attributes_Methods.md](concepts/Attributes_Methods.md): Properties and behaviors.
  - [Accessing_Members.md](concepts/Accessing_Members.md): Using dot notation.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Create a simple class.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Instantiate objects and manipulate attributes.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files for practice problems.

### **How to Use This Module:**

1. **Explore the Concepts:**
   - Start with `Classes.md` to understand how classes serve as blueprints.
   - Read `Objects.md` to learn about creating instances.
   - Proceed to `Attributes_Methods.md` to grasp how properties and behaviors are defined.
   - Study `Accessing_Members.md` to see how to interact with object members.

2. **Apply Your Knowledge:**
   - Attempt the exercises in the `practice_problems/` directory.
   - Use the solutions in the `Solutions/` folder to check your work.

3. **Engage Further:**
   - Think of real-world entities that can be modeled as classes and objects.
   - Discuss your ideas with peers or mentors to deepen your understanding.
