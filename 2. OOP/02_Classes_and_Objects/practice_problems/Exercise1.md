# Exercise 1: Creating a Simple Class

## **Objective:**

Define a class that models a **Book** with attributes and methods.

## **Task:**

1. **Define a class** named `Book` that has the following **attributes**:
   - `title` (string)
   - `author` (string)
   - `pages` (int)

2. **Include methods**:
   - `printDetails()`: Displays the book's details.

3. **In your `main` function**:
   - Create an object of the `Book` class.
   - Assign values to the object's attributes.
   - Call the `printDetails()` method.

## **Example Output:**

```
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Pages: 180
```
