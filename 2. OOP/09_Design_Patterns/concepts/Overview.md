# Overview of Design Patterns

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Why Use Design Patterns?
- **Reusability:** Simplify the design process by using well-known solutions.
- **Maintainability:** Make the code easier to understand and modify.
- **Scalability:** Enable you to design robust systems that can grow over time.

### Categories of Design Patterns:
- **Creational:** Deal with object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
- **Structural:** Concerned with object composition (e.g., Adapter, Decorator).
- **Behavioral:** Focus on communication between objects (e.g., Observer, Strategy).

In this module, we will cover a few common ones: Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy.
