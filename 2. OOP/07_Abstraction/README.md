# Abstraction

Welcome to the **Abstraction** module of our OOP learning journey! Abstraction is all about simplifying complex systems by exposing only the essential parts while hiding the underlying implementation details.

In this module, you'll learn:
- **Abstract Classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated and contain at least one pure virtual function.
- **Interfaces:** In C++ (since there is no explicit keyword), an “interface” is typically implemented as an abstract class with only pure virtual functions.
- **Implementing Abstraction:** How to design and use abstract classes and interfaces to build modular, maintainable software.

### Contents:

- **concepts/**
  - [Abstract_Classes.md](concepts/Abstract_Classes.md): Learn what abstract classes are and how to use pure virtual functions.
  - [Interfaces.md](concepts/Interfaces.md): Understand how to design interfaces using abstract classes.
  - [Implementing_Abstraction.md](concepts/Implementing_Abstraction.md): See examples of abstraction in action.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Implement an abstract class and derive from it.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Create an interface and a class that implements the interface.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files for the exercises.

### How to Use This Module:

1. **Study the Concepts:**
   - Start with the concept files to understand abstraction.
2. **Practice:**
   - Work on the exercises and then refer to the solutions.
3. **Experiment:**
   - Try modifying the examples and create your own abstract classes or interfaces.

Happy coding!
