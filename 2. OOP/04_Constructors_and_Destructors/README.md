# Constructors and Destructors

Welcome to the fourth module of our OOP learning journey! In this section, we'll explore how objects are created and destroyed in C++. You'll learn about constructors, destructors, and the different types of constructors that can be used to manage object lifecycles effectively.

### **Contents:**

- **concepts/**
  - [Constructors.md](concepts/Constructors.md): Understanding constructors and their role.
  - [Destructors.md](concepts/Destructors.md): Understanding destructors and their role.
  - [Constructor_Types.md](concepts/Constructor_Types.md): Types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy constructors).
  - [Best_Practices.md](concepts/Best_Practices.md): Tips for using constructors and destructors effectively.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Using constructors to initialize objects.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Implementing copy constructors and destructors.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files for practice problems.

### **How to Use This Module:**

1. **Study the Concepts:**
   - Begin with `Constructors.md` to understand how objects are initialized.
   - Read `Destructors.md` to learn how objects are destroyed and resources are released.
   - Explore `Constructor_Types.md` for different ways to construct objects.
   - Review `Best_Practices.md` to learn how to use constructors and destructors effectively.

2. **Practice and Apply:**
   - Attempt the exercises in the `practice_problems/` directory.
   - Use the solutions in the `Solutions/` folder to check your work.

3. **Reflect and Experiment:**
   - Modify the examples to reinforce your understanding.
   - Observe how constructors and destructors affect object behavior.
