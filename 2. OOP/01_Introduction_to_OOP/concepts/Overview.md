# Overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## **What is a Programming Paradigm?**

A **programming paradigm** is a fundamental style of computer programming that provides a way of structuring and thinking about code. It dictates how programming elements are used and how programs are structured. Common paradigms include:

- **Procedural Programming:** Focuses on a sequence of instructions to perform computations.
- **Functional Programming:** Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Organizes code by encapsulating related properties and behaviors into objects.

## **Introduction to OOP**

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and programs. It utilizes several key concepts:

- **Objects:** Instances of classes that represent entities with attributes and behaviors.
- **Classes:** Blueprints that define the structure and behavior (data and methods) that objects of the class all share.
- **Methods:** Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of the objects.
- **Attributes:** Variables defined inside a class that represent the state or data of objects.

## **The Essence of OOP**

OOP allows developers to create modules that can be reused and modified without affecting other parts of the program. It's centered around data rather than logic, meaning it focuses on the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
