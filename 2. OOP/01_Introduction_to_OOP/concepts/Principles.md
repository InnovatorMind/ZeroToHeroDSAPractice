# Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is built upon four core principles that enable robust and maintainable code. These principles are:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Abstraction**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**

## **1. Encapsulation**

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.

- **Data Hiding:** Internal object details (attributes and methods) are hidden from the outside world.
- **Access Modifiers:** Keywords like `private`, `protected`, and `public` control the level of access.

**Benefits:**

- **Improves modularity.**
- **Protects object integrity by preventing unintended interference.**

## **2. Abstraction**

**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It focuses on the essential qualities of something rather than one specific example.

- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Define methods without implementations to be overridden in derived classes.
- **Simplifies code understanding and maintenance.**

**Benefits:**

- **Reduces complexity.**
- **Enhances code reusability.**

## **3. Inheritance**

**Inheritance** allows a new class to take on the properties and methods of an existing class. The new class is called the **child class** or **derived class**, and the existing class is the **parent class** or **base class**.

- **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one base class.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** A class inherits from more than one base class (varies by programming language).

**Benefits:**

- **Promotes code reusability.**
- **Establishes a natural hierarchy.**

## **4. Polymorphism**

**Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It provides a single interface to entities of different types.

- **Compile-time (Overloading):** Same function name with different parameters.
- **Runtime (Overriding):** Derived class modifies the behavior of a base class method.

**Benefits:**

- **Improves code flexibility.**
- **Enhances maintainability by decoupling objects.**

**Understanding these principles is crucial for mastering OOP. They work together to create systems that are modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.**
