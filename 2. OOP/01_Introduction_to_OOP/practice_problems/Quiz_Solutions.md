# OOP Principles Quiz - Solutions

---

## **Answers:**

1. **Encapsulation** is the OOP principle that bundles data and methods operating on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which protects the object's integrity by preventing external interference.

2. **A class** is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behaviors (attributes and methods) that objects of the class will have. **An object** is an instance of a class; it occupies memory and has a state.

3. **Inheritance** allows a new class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class). This promotes code reusability by enabling the new class to use existing code without rewriting it.

4. **Polymorphism** means "many forms" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. An example is a function that can take objects of different classes and perform actions based on their actual class.

5. **Abstraction** simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features. It allows developers to work at a higher level without worrying about underlying complexities.

6. **Matching:**
