# Inheritance

Welcome to the fifth module of our OOP learning journey! In this section, we'll explore **Inheritance**, a fundamental concept that allows classes to derive properties and behaviors from existing classes. You'll learn how to implement inheritance in C++, the different types of inheritance, and how to override methods to customize functionality.

### **Contents:**

- **concepts/**
  - [Inheritance.md](concepts/Inheritance.md): Understanding the concept of inheritance.
  - [Inheritance_Types.md](concepts/Inheritance_Types.md): Single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.
  - [Base_Derived_Classes.md](concepts/Base_Derived_Classes.md): Understanding parent-child relationships.
  - [Overriding_Methods.md](concepts/Overriding_Methods.md): Modifying inherited behavior.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Implement different types of inheritance.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Override methods in derived classes.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files for practice problems.

### **How to Use This Module:**

1. **Study the Concepts:**
   - Begin with `Inheritance.md` to understand the core idea.
   - Read `Inheritance_Types.md` to learn about various inheritance forms.
   - Explore `Base_Derived_Classes.md` to understand class relationships.
   - Review `Overriding_Methods.md` to learn how to modify inherited methods.

2. **Practice and Apply:**
   - Attempt the exercises in the `practice_problems/` directory.
   - Use the solutions in the `Solutions/` folder to check your work.

3. **Reflect and Experiment:**
   - Think about how inheritance promotes code reusability.
   - Modify the examples to reinforce your understanding.
