# Encapsulation

Welcome to the third module of our OOP learning journey! In this section, we'll explore **Encapsulation**, one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming. You'll learn how to protect the integrity of data within your classes by controlling access to attributes and methods. We'll delve into access modifiers, getters and setters, and the importance of data hiding.

### **Contents:**

- **concepts/**
  - [Encapsulation.md](concepts/Encapsulation.md): Understanding encapsulation in OOP.
  - [Access_Modifiers.md](concepts/Access_Modifiers.md): Explanation of `private`, `public`, and `protected`.
  - [Getters_Setters.md](concepts/Getters_Setters.md): Using methods to access and modify private data.
  - [Data_Hiding.md](concepts/Data_Hiding.md): Importance and techniques of hiding internal object details.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Implement encapsulation in a class.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Refactor code to use getters and setters.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files for practice problems.

### **How to Use This Module:**

1. **Study the Concepts:**
   - Begin with `Encapsulation.md` to understand the core idea.
   - Read `Access_Modifiers.md` to learn how access control works.
   - Proceed to `Getters_Setters.md` to see how to safely access private data.
   - Explore `Data_Hiding.md` to appreciate the importance of hiding internal details.

2. **Practice and Apply:**
   - Attempt the exercises in the `practice_problems/` directory.
   - Use the solutions in the `Solutions/` folder to check your work.

3. **Reflect and Experiment:**
   - Consider how encapsulation enhances code security and maintainability.
   - Modify the examples to reinforce your understanding.
