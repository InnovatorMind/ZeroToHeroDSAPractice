# Data Hiding: Protecting Object Integrity

## **What is Data Hiding?**

Data hiding is an aspect of encapsulation that restricts access to the inner workings of a class. By hiding internal data, we prevent external code from becoming dependent on internal implementation details that are likely to change.

## **Why Hide Data?**

- **Security:** Prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- **Integrity:** Ensure the object remains in a valid state.
- **Simplicity:** Expose only what is necessary to the outside world.

## **Implementation in C++**

- Use the `private` keyword to restrict accessgi to class members.
- Provide `public` methods to interact with the data safely.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Thermometer {
private:
    double temperature; // Private data member

public:
    void setTemperature(double temp) {
        if (temp >= -273.15) { // Validate temperature (absolute zero)
            temperature = temp;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid temperature!" << endl;
        }
    }

    double getTemperature() {
        return temperature;
    }
};
```

## **Benefits**

- **Control Over Data:** Only allow valid data to be set.
- **Flexibility:** Internal changes do not affect external code.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to locate and fix issues related to data handling.

## **Common Misconceptions**

- **Data Hiding is Not Data Security:** It protects against accidental misuse, not malicious attacks.
- **Private Does Not Mean Inaccessible:** It means controlled access through defined interfaces.

**Remember:**

- Hide the data, not functionality.
- Provide necessary interfaces for interaction.

---

**Practice:**

- Review your classes to ensure proper data hiding.
- Implement data validation in your setters.

**Proceed to Practice Problems:**

- Apply these concepts in [Exercise1.md](../practice_problems/Exercise1.md).
- Refactor existing code in [Exercise2.md](../practice_problems/Exercise2.md) to enhance encapsulation.
