# Polymorphism

Welcome to the sixth module of our OOP learning journey! In this section, you'll explore **Polymorphism**â€”the ability of objects to take multiple forms. You'll learn:

- **Function Overloading & Operator Overloading** (compile-time polymorphism)
- **Method Overriding and Virtual Functions** (runtime polymorphism)

### Contents:

- **concepts/**
  - [Overloading.md](concepts/Overloading.md): Learn about function and operator overloading.
  - [Overriding.md](concepts/Overriding.md): Understand how derived classes can redefine methods.
  - [Virtual_Functions.md](concepts/Virtual_Functions.md): Discover the power of virtual functions for runtime polymorphism.
- **practice_problems/**
  - [Exercise1.md](practice_problems/Exercise1.md): Implement function overloading in a C++ class.
  - [Exercise2.md](practice_problems/Exercise2.md): Use virtual functions in a class hierarchy to achieve runtime polymorphism.
  - **Solutions/**: Contains solution files (Exercise1_Solution.cpp and Exercise2_Solution.cpp).

### How to Use This Module:

1. **Study the Concepts:**  
   Start with the concept files to understand how overloading and overriding allow flexible code design.

2. **Practice:**  
   Work through the exercises provided and then compare your solutions with the ones in the Solutions folder.

3. **Experiment:**  
   Tweak the code examples and try creating your own overloaded or virtual functions to reinforce your learning.

Happy coding!
