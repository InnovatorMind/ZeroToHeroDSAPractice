# Exercise 1: Implement Function Overloading

## Objective:

Create a class that demonstrates function overloading by providing multiple `multiply()` methods with different parameter types and counts.

## Task:

1. **Define a class** named `Multiplier` with the following methods:
   - `multiply(int a, int b)`: Returns the product of two integers.
   - `multiply(double a, double b)`: Returns the product of two doubles.
   - `multiply(int a, int b, int c)`: Returns the product of three integers.

2. **In your `main` function:**
   - Create an object of `Multiplier`.
   - Call each overloaded `multiply()` method with appropriate arguments.
   - Display the results.

## Example Output:

```
Product of two integers: 12
Product of two doubles: 10.50
Product of three integers: 24
```

**Instructions:**

- Write your code in a file named `Exercise1.cpp`.
- Ensure each overloaded version does what is expected.
