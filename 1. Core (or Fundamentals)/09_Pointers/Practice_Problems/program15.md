### Passing Array by Value (Simple Method)
**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and use.
- **Safety**: The function cannot modify the original array, which can prevent unintended side effects.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Inefficiency**: Copies the entire array, which can be slow and memory-intensive for large arrays.
- **Limited Use**: Not suitable for modifying the original array.

### Passing Array by Pointer
**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency**: Avoids copying the entire array, making it faster and more memory-efficient.
- **Flexibility**: Allows the function to modify the original array.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity**: Requires explicit dereferencing and pointer arithmetic, which can be harder to read and maintain.
- **Safety**: The function can modify the original array, which can lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.

### Passing Array by Reference
**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency**: Avoids copying the entire array, similar to pointers.
- **Safety**: The function can modify the original array, but it's more explicit and safer than pointers.
- **Simplicity**: Easier to use compared to pointers as it doesn't require explicit dereferencing.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited Flexibility**: The size of the array must be known at compile time, which can be restrictive.

### Why Use Each Method?
- **Simple Method**: Used when you don't need to modify the original array and want to ensure safety.
- **Pointer Method**: Used when you need to modify the original array and want to avoid copying large arrays.
- **Reference Method**: Used when you need to modify the original array but want a simpler and safer approach compared to pointers.
